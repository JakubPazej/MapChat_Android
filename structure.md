# Navigation Structure of MapChat

When you first open the map, you are met with the MainActivity page, where you can sign in. 
Once you click sign in, the firebase authentification fragment is started.
Once signed in, you are brought to the Reading page, where you can see the latest posts from around the world.
From here, you can go to either the Post page, where you can post a message and return to the Reading page,
or you can go to the Map Fragment, where you can see where the posts are coming from.
From the reading page, you can also click your profile at the top to access your Profile page,
or click a name next to a post to go to their UserProfile page.
