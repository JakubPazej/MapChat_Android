# MAPCHAT

This app is designed for people from all over the world to communicate, and to see where in the world these people are coming from. 
This will allow people to make new friends from all over. This could also be localised, and coul dbe used by parents to see where there kids are if they need a pick-up,
or just to make sure they are safe. This could also be used by local guards, with a scanner looking for keywords, where someone could post that they need help, and 
the polic would be able to see the exact location of distress.

## Getting Started
Once you download the app, you can open it and click sign in. Once you make an account you can head into the post page, where you can read the latest posts from around the world.
You will need to give the app permission to use location.
We used firebase to make the app, the firebase project can be found here
